# ETL Data with Python Project: Analyze User Behavior on TV and Digital Content Apps
## Project Description:

This project involved developing an ETL pipeline using Python to analyze user behavior data from a TV viewing and digital content app. The raw data, stored in JSON format (approximately 4.5 million lines per file),  was spread across four folders representing four days of user activity.

## Technical Skills Highlighted:

- ETL Processing: Employed Python libraries (pandas) to extract data from multiple JSON files, transform it through aggregation and merging, and load it into a desired format (OLAP cube) for further analysis.
- Data Exploration and Visualization: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior patterns. Utilized data visualization libraries (seaborn, pyplot) to create informative charts and graphs that effectively communicate insights.
- Data Storage and Management: Leveraged Python libraries to import the processed data into a database or export it to a user-friendly format like Excel for further analysis or reporting.
## Key Tools and Technologies:

- Python Programming Language
- pandas library for data manipulation
- seaborn and pyplot libraries for data visualization
- os library for file system interaction
